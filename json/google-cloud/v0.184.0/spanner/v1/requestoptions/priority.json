Note that priority is not applicable\nfor [BeginTransaction][google.spanner.v1.Spanner.BeginTransaction].<\/p>\n<p>The priority acts as a hint to the Cloud Spanner scheduler and does not\nguarantee priority or order of execution. For example:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Some parts of a write operation always execute at <code>PRIORITY_HIGH<\/code>,\nregardless of the specified priority. This may cause you to see an\nincrease in high priority workload even when executing a low priority\nrequest. This can also potentially cause a priority inversion where a\nlower priority request will be fulfilled ahead of a higher priority\nrequest.<\/li>\n<li>If a transaction contains multiple operations with different priorities,\nCloud Spanner does not guarantee to process the higher priority\noperations first. There may be other constraints to satisfy, such as\norder of operations.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Protobuf type <code>google.spanner.v1.RequestOptions.Priority<\/code><\/p>","examples":[],"resources":[],"methods":[]}
