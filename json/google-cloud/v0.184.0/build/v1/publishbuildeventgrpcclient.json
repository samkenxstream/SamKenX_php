Some BuildEvents are used to declare the\nbeginning and end of major portions of a Build; these are called\nLifecycleEvents, and are used (for example) to indicate the beginning or end\nof a Build, and the beginning or end of an Invocation attempt (there can be\nmore than 1 Invocation in a Build if, for example, a failure occurs somewhere\nand it needs to be retried).<\/p>\n<p>Other, build-tool events represent actions taken by the Build tool, such as\ntarget objects produced via compilation, tests run, et cetera.
