An <code>Occurrence<\/code>\ncontains information about a specific analysis instance on a resource. An\noccurrence refers to a <code>Note<\/code>. A note contains details describing the\nanalysis and is generally stored in a separate project, called a <code>Provider<\/code>.\nMultiple occurrences can refer to the same note.<\/p>\n<p>For example, an SSL vulnerability could affect multiple images. In this case,\nthere would be one note for the vulnerability and an occurrence for each\nimage with the vulnerability referring to that note.<\/p>\n<p>This class provides the ability to make remote calls to the backing service through method\ncalls that map to API methods. Sample code to get started:<\/p>\n<pre><code>$grafeasClient = new GrafeasClient();\ntry {\n    $formattedParent = $grafeasClient-&gt;projectName('[PROJECT]');\n    $notes = [];\n    $response = $grafeasClient-&gt;batchCreateNotes($formattedParent, $notes);\n} finally {\n    $grafeasClient-&gt;close();\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Many parameters require resource names to be formatted in a particular way. To\nassist with these names, this class includes a format method for each type of\nname, and additionally a parseName method to extract the individual identifiers\ncontained within formatted names that are returned by the API.<\/p>\n<p>Extends \\Grafeas\\V1\\Gapic\\GrafeasGapicClient<\/p>","examples":[],"resources":[],"methods":[]}
