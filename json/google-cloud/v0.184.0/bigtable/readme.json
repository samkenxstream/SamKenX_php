{"id":"bigtable\/readme","type":"guide","title":"Google Cloud Bigtable for PHP","name":"Google Cloud Bigtable for PHP","description":"<body>\n\n\n\n\n<p>A high performance NoSQL database service for large analytical and operational workloads.<\/p>\n<h3>Installation<\/h3>\n<p>To begin, install the preferred dependency manager for PHP, <a href=\"https:\/\/getcomposer.org\/\">Composer<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Now to install just this component:<\/p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">$ composer require google\/cloud-bigtable<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Or to install the entire suite of components at once:<\/p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">$ composer require google\/cloud<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>This component supports both REST over HTTP\/1.1 and gRPC. In order to take advantage of the benefits offered by gRPC (such as streaming methods)\nplease see our <a href=\"https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/php\/grpc\">gRPC installation guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Notable Client Differences<\/h3>\n<p>The handwritten client offered by this package differs from the others in <code>google-cloud-php<\/code> in that it more directly wraps our generated clients.\nThis means some of the idioms and configuration options you are used to may differ slightly. The most notable differences are outlined below:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A key file is now provided through the <code>credentials<\/code> configuration option as opposed to either <code>keyFile<\/code> or <code>keyFilePath<\/code>.<\/li>\n<li>There is now more granular control over retry logic. Please see <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/googleapis\/google-cloud-php\/blob\/main\/Bigtable\/src\/V2\/resources\/bigtable_client_config.json\">the <code>bigtable_client_config.json<\/code> file<\/a>\nfor an example of the configuration which can be passed into the client at construction time.<\/li>\n<li>Exceptions triggered at the network level utilize the base class <code>Google\\ApiCore\\ApiException<\/code> as opposed to <code>Google\\Cloud\\Core\\ServiceException<\/code>.<\/li>\n<li>The <code>authHttpHandler<\/code> and <code>httpHandler<\/code> client configuration options are now provided through <code>$credentialsConfig['authHttpHandler']<\/code>\nand <code>$transportConfig['httpHandler']<\/code>, respectively. Additionally, please note the <code>httpHandler<\/code> should now return an implementation of <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/guzzle\/promises\/blob\/master\/src\/PromiseInterface.php\">Guzzle's <code>PromiseInterface<\/code><\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Authentication<\/h3>\n<p>Please see our <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/googleapis\/google-cloud-php\/blob\/main\/AUTHENTICATION.md\">Authentication guide<\/a> for more information\non authenticating your client. Once authenticated, you'll be ready to start making requests.<\/p>\n<p>When going through the authentication guide, please take note that the handwritten client for this package will more closely follow the conventions\noutlined for the generated clients.<\/p>\n<h3>Sample<\/h3>\n<pre><code class=\"language-php\">require 'vendor\/autoload.php';\n\nuse Google\\Cloud\\Bigtable\\BigtableClient;\n\n$bigtable = new BigtableClient();\n$table = $bigtable-&gt;table('my-instance', 'my-table');\n$rows = $table-&gt;readRows();\n\nforeach ($rows as $row) {\n    print_r($row) . PHP_EOL;\n}<\/code><\/pre>\n<h3>Version<\/h3>\n<p>This component is considered GA (generally available). As such, it will not introduce backwards-incompatible changes in\nany minor or patch releases. We will address issues and requests with the highest priority.<\/p>\n<h3>Next Steps<\/h3>\n<p>Take a look at and understand the <a href=\"https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/bigtable\/docs\">official documentation<\/a>.<\/p><\/body>","methods":[]}
