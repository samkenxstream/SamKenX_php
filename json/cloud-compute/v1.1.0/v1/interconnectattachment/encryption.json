Can only be specified at attachment creation for PARTNER or DEDICATED attachments. Possible values are: - NONE - This is the default value, which means that the VLAN attachment carries unencrypted traffic. VMs are able to send traffic to, or receive traffic from, such a VLAN attachment. - IPSEC - The VLAN attachment carries only encrypted traffic that is encrypted by an IPsec device, such as an HA VPN gateway or third-party IPsec VPN. VMs cannot directly send traffic to, or receive traffic from, such a VLAN attachment. To use <em>IPsec-encrypted Cloud Interconnect<\/em>, the VLAN attachment must be created with this option.
